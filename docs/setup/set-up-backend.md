title: Setting up the backend
---
Setting up the backend takes a number of manual steps which can differ for local development and server operation.

* [Installing and running on the server](../backend/install-and-running-on-server.md)
* [Setting up the backend for local development](../backend/install-and-running-locally.md)

After the installation you can adapt the application to your own needs with the following steps:

* [Create core data and import users](../backend/create-core-data-import-users.md)
* [Adapt the mail templates](../backend/mailservice-templates.md)
